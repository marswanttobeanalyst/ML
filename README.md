# My diary of learning Machine Learning
My progress of learning Machine Learning. The notes, the tutorial and the projects.

## Supervised Learning
algorithms that learn x to y or input to output mappings. The key characteristic of supervised learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from.

### 1. Regression
algorithm learns to predict numbers out of infinitely many possible numbers. 

#### Linear Regression
fitting a straight line to your data.

##### Univariate Linear Regression (One-variable linear regression)

###### Cost Function
The cost function, J(Î¸) measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual true values for y. In linear regression, the goal is to find the optimal values for the parameters w and b that minimize this cost function. By minimizing J, we ensure that our model's predictions are as close as possible to the true values, thereby improving the accuracy of the model.

```math
\[ J(w, b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \hat{y}^{(i)} - y^{(i)} \right)^2 \]

### 2. Classification
The learning algorithm has to make a prediction of a category, all of a small set of possible outputs or numbers.

## Unsupervised Learning
the data comes only with inputs x but not output labels y, and the algorithm has to find some structure or some pattern or something interesting in the data.

### 1. Classification
Algorithm that groups similar data points together based on their similar features.


### 2. Anomaly Detection

### 3. Dimensionality Reduction
